# Dev's Daily Digest

Dev's Daily Digest is an innovative digital platform designed to keep developers and tech enthusiasts at the forefront of the rapidly evolving tech landscape. This project gathers the latest news, trends, and insights from the world of web development, UX/UI design, data analysis, and much more, ensuring a comprehensive and up-to-date feed for its users.

By all that I mean it uses RSS feeds to give me articles everyday instead of going through 20+ emails :)
